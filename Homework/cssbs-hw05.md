1. Compound assignment operator is used to combine any arithmetic operator with the assignment operator. It is shorthand to assign and calculate an arithmetic operation on a variable. C# recognizes
that the arithmetic operator followed by the equals is shorthand and returns the result as the variable assined to the left of the compound assignment. 

1.+=, *=, /=, %=, += and -= are all of the compound assignment operators.

1. two ways to increment a variable by 5 is: variablename = variablename +5 || variablename+=5
   two ways decrement a variable by 5 is: variablename= variablename-50 || variablename -=50
   
1. A while loop runs until the condition that is in the boolean expression is false.

1. An iteration variable is a variable that increments or decrements in a for loop.

1. If I don't change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block than the loop will run forever.

1. For loops have three parts, the initialization, termination condition, and update control variable. You can omit any of the three parts inside of the for loop, omitting the boolean expression
defuals to true, omitting the initialization and update turns the for loop into a while loop. If you omit all three parts you will have a while loop without a way to end it.

1. Using the do keyword with a while loop will insure that the body always executes at least once.

1. The break keyword can be used to exit out of a for loop. 

1. The continue keyword can be used to skip to the next iteration immediatly regardless of location in the body of the loop.

1. An intentional infinite loop that I would run would happen in game design such as an update function that should constantly run to update my camera or entities.

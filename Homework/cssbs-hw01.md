1. Console App is an application that runs in a Command Prompt window instead of providing a graphical user interface.

2. .Net Core is newer, open source, builds portable apps, and is cross platform. .Net Framework is older and provides more features but is stuck on windows. 

3. The main method desiginates the program's entry point. 

4. TextHello.sln is a top level solution file. TextHello.csproj is the c# project file is the second level container and held within the solution file. AssembylInfo.cs is the c# source file and holds assembly info. This defines a class called AssembylInfo that contains a method called Main.

5. Purpose of a namespace is to solve the confusion of programmers naming all of thier code with the same name. It creates a container for items such as classes.

6. Using statements brings a specified namespace into scope and frees you from having to fully qualify the names of classes in your code. 

7. Entry point for a console app is the main method. Entry point for a Universal Windows Platform is the App.xaml file.

8. An assembly is a file that holds compiled code that your application can use. It makes up the dynamic linked libraries(dlls).

9. Console class contains 18 different WriteLine() methods.

10. The relationship between assemby and namespace is not equivalent. A single assembly can contain a class defined in many namespaces
and a single namespace can span multiple assemblies. There is no relationship.

11. A graphical app is an application that has a user interface that can be interacted by the user. There are pre made templates built into 
visual studio called Universal Windows Platform, Windows Presentation Foundation, and Windows Forms App. It does not run in the command console.

12. Build compiles the C# code. It saves the file and results in a program you can run.

13. Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficeint execution by a software interpreter. Common Intermediate Language is the intermediate language binary instruction set 
defined within common language infrastructure specification. I think CIL is bytecode becuase it is an instruction set that is used by any common language infrastructure supported environments.

14. Debug runs the application in debug mode. Debug mode should run the application step by step to allow the coder to see how thier application runs step by step. This is accomplished by using an
interpreter.
